# JS Digits

Function should output this form of the input number as an array of numbers and repetition words.

## Example

The groups parameter defines the size of each group so the example above would be input as

```
parseNumber([0,1,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,4], [5,6])
```

And output

```
'zero one triple three three double nine double seven four'
```

## Testing

```
npm install
./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
```
